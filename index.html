  <h1>Hello, I'm an aspiring ICT professional</h1>

  <p>
    I am currently pursuing an Associate Degree in ICT. Before this, I completed a Level 4 vocational education (MBO 4) in ICT, which provided me with a solid technical foundation and hands-on experience.
  </p>

  <p>
    My passion for computers started long before my studies. I have always been curious about how systems work, and I enjoy solving problems with smart solutions. This curiosity led me to explore technology in my free time, and eventually to pursue formal education in ICT.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through internships and school projects, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to apply my knowledge in real-world settings. These experiences taught me not only how to work with modern technologies, but also how to collaborate in professional environments.
